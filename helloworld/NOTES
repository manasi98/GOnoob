Go code is grouped into packages, and packages are grouped into modules.
Module specifies dependencies needed to run code, including the Go version and the set of other modules it requires.

For production use, youâ€™d publish the example.com/greetings module from its repository (with a module path that reflected its published location), where Go tools could find it to download it. For now, because you haven't published the module yet, you need to adapt the example.com/hello module so it can find the example.com/greetings code on your local file system.
To do that, use the go mod edit command to edit the example.com/hello module to redirect Go tools from its module path (where the module isn't) to the local directory (where it is).
